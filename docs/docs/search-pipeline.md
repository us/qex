# Search Pipeline

## Overview

```
Query → Analysis → BM25 Search ──→ Fusion → Re-ranking → Results
                 → Dense Search ─↗ (optional)
```

## 1. Query Analysis

Every search query goes through analysis before hitting the engines.

**Tokenization** — Split on whitespace, punctuation, camelCase boundaries, and snake_case separators.

**Stop-word removal** — Common words (`the`, `a`, `is`, `in`, etc.) are stripped to reduce noise.

**Intent detection** — The query is classified into one of 6 intent categories:

| Intent | Trigger patterns | Effect |
|--------|-----------------|--------|
| Function | `function`, `fn`, `def`, `func`, `method`, `handler` | Boosts function/method chunks |
| Class | `class`, `struct`, `type`, `interface`, `trait`, `enum` | Boosts class/struct chunks |
| Error | `error`, `err`, `exception`, `panic`, `fail`, `bug` | Boosts error_handling tagged chunks |
| Config | `config`, `setting`, `env`, `option`, `flag` | Boosts configuration code |
| Test | `test`, `spec`, `assert`, `mock`, `fixture` | Reduces test penalty |
| API | `api`, `endpoint`, `route`, `handler`, `middleware`, `http` | Boosts API-related chunks |

**Synonym expansion** — 16 synonym pairs expand queries. Examples:
- `error` ↔ `err`, `exception`
- `function` ↔ `fn`, `func`, `def`
- `remove` ↔ `delete`
- `create` ↔ `new`, `init`

## 2. BM25 Search

Tantivy-based full-text search with a 14-field schema. Field boosts prioritize symbol names and paths over raw content.

| Field | Boost | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| `name` | 5.0x | Symbol name |
| `path_tokens` | 2.0x | Tokenized file path |
| `docstring` | 1.5x | Documentation string |
| `tags` | 1.5x | Semantic tags |
| `content` | 1.0x | Full source text |
| `language` | — | Source language (filter) |
| `chunk_type` | — | Chunk type (filter) |
| `path` | — | Full file path (stored) |
| `start_line` / `end_line` | — | Line range (stored) |
| `decorators` | — | Decorators/attributes (stored) |
| `complexity` | — | Complexity score (stored) |

The query is applied as a disjunction across all boosted fields. Tantivy handles tokenization, stemming, and BM25 scoring internally.

## 3. Dense Vector Search (Optional)

Requires the `dense` feature flag and the Arctic Embed S model.

**Embedding** — Queries and chunks are embedded into 384-dimensional vectors using the ONNX Runtime. Chunks are batched (64 per batch) during indexing.

**HNSW Index** — usearch builds an approximate nearest neighbor index. Cosine similarity is used for retrieval.

**Model** — Snowflake Arctic Embed S (33 MB, INT8 quantized). Stored at `~/.qex/models/arctic-embed-s/`.

## 4. Reciprocal Rank Fusion

When both BM25 and dense results are available, they're merged using RRF:

```
score = Σ 1/(k + rank)    where k = 60
```

Each result gets a fusion score based on its rank in each engine's result list. Results appearing in both lists get higher combined scores.

## 5. Multi-Factor Re-ranking

After fusion (or after BM25 alone), results go through multi-factor re-ranking:

**File type boost:**

| Category | Multiplier |
|----------|-----------|
| Source code (.rs, .py, .ts, .go, etc.) | 1.0x |
| Config files (.toml, .json, .yaml) | 0.9x |
| Documentation (.md) | 0.8x |
| Test files | 0.7x |
| Vendor/generated | 0.3x |

**Chunk type boost** — When query intent matches chunk type (e.g., "class" intent + class chunk = 1.3x).

**Name match boost** — Exact name match gives 1.5x boost.

**Path boost** — Query terms appearing in file path add a boost.

**Tag boost** — When query intent matches chunk tags (e.g., "error" intent + `error_handling` tag).

**Docstring boost** — Chunks with docstrings get a small boost.

**Complexity penalty** — Very complex chunks get slightly penalized.

**Translation dedup** — Duplicate i18n/locale files are deduplicated.

## 6. Score Thresholding

Low-relevance results are filtered out:

- **Minimum threshold**: 12% of top result score
- **Knee detection**: If there's a sharp score drop between consecutive results, results below the knee are cut
